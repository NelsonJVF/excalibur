# Excalibur

This project aims to provide a clean, easy access to data in Excel sheets. We had the need to access this data from Ant tasks and used Apache POI, but as we discussed moving some of those elements from Excel spreadsheet into a database we noted how tightly coupled to POI objects the whole code was. As such, we made a decision of transforming the code into hiding the access behind Maps and Lists, which makes it, in my opinion, much more transparent.
